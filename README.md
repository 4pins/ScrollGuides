<p>ScrollGuides seeks to take the amazing promise of 360 degree scrolling  and help the user better convey their intentions through presetting the  scrolling outcomes they desire.  Tested on various pointer input  devices, ScrollGuides delivers a highly compatible experience with  greater control.<br><br>
Regardless if you want to filter out small  scroll movements or guide your scrolling in a perfectly straight  horizontal or vertical direction, ScrollGuides delivers a more  intentional and linear experience.  Simple manual adjustments allow for  different behavior based on the user’s current needs.<br><br>

## Two Options, Many Possibilities

### Filter It.
![Filter Control](./images/Filter.png)
ScrollGuides gives you the ability to control the sensitivity of scrolling by filtering out small, likely inadvertent, movements without losing inertia.  Quickly adjust from maximum, unmodified, sensitivity all the way down to filtering out all scrolling, temporarily, with carefully curated levels in-between.  From overly sensitive applications to ergonomic issues, this option has a surprising ability to reduce frustrations.

### Guide it.

360 degree freehand scrolling can be a wonderful navigation tool.  However, it often has unintended consequences.  From slowly drifting off course in a spreadsheet to apps that activate functionality by swiping left or right, having some guides available can greatly increase productivity.  In practice these two sets of options compliment each-other very well to nearly eliminate unexpected and unintended scrolling behavior.
